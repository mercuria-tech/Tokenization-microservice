## Notes
- All tasks and deliverables must strictly follow Docs/asset_tokenization_prd.md and .cursor/rules.
- Update this file after each section implementation and generate a full report for completed sections.
- Deep testing and compliance checks are required after each major build step.
- **Architecture migration completed successfully - now compatible with Cloudflare deployment target.**
