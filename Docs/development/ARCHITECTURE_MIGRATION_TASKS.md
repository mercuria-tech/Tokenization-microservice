## Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Required Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@cloudflare/workers-types": "^4.0.0",
    "wrangler": "^3.0.0",
    "itty-router": "^3.0.0",
    "zod": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Workers Configuration
```toml
# wrangler.toml
name = "asset-tokenization-microservice"
main = "src/worker.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[env.production]
name = "asset-tokenization-microservice-prod"

[[env.production.r2_buckets]]
binding = "R2"
bucket_name = "asset-tokenization-docs"

[[env.production.d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "asset-tokenization-db"
database_id = "your-database-id"
```

### 5.3 Migration Checklist
- [ ] All Fastify routes converted to Workers handlers
- [ ] Database queries updated for Workers environment
- [ ] File storage migrated to R2
- [ ] Authentication system working in Workers
- [ ] Blockchain integration functional
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

## Risk Mitigation

### 5.1 Potential Issues
- **Database Performance**: Workers have different performance characteristics
- **File Upload Limits**: Workers have request size limitations
- **Cold Start Latency**: First request may be slower
- **Memory Limitations**: Workers have memory constraints

### 5.2 Mitigation Strategies
- Implement connection pooling for external databases
- Use streaming for large file uploads
- Optimize code for cold start performance
- Monitor memory usage and optimize

---

## Success Criteria

### 5.1 Functional Requirements
- [ ] All API endpoints working in Workers environment
- [ ] Database operations functional
- [ ] File upload/download working with R2
- [ ] Authentication and authorization working
- [ ] Blockchain integration operational

### 5.2 Performance Requirements
- [ ] API response time < 500ms (95th percentile)
- [ ] File upload time < 5 seconds
- [ ] Database query time < 100ms
- [ ] Cold start time < 1 second

### 5.3 Quality Requirements
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] All security scans passing
- [ ] Code quality gates passing
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
